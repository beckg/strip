# strip

I use veroboard for many of my projects, which in the past has led to either very unsightly boards
or lots of pencil drawings as I work out how to route the signals.
    
I periodically look for software to alleviate these problems but have failed to find anything that made 
the task any easier or that I was prepared to pay for. I did find 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/libby8dev/stripes">Stripes</a>
and liked much of what I saw, but found some problems with the implementation.
Therefore I took some of the ideas and developed an alternative solution. I know that one should resist 
not-invented-here, but sometimes it is fun to play!  The philosophy of using Java so 
that you have a cross platform solution is important.
