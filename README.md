# strip

      I use veroboard for many of my projects, which in the past has led to either very unsightly boards
      or lots of pencil drawings as I work out how to route the signals.
    
      I periodically look for software to alleviate these problems but have failed to find anything that made 
      the task any easier or that I was prepared to pay for. I did find 
      <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/libby8dev/stripes">Stripes</a>
      and liked much of what I saw, but found some problems with the implementation.
      Therefore I took some of the ideas and developed an alternative solution. I know that one should resist 
      not-invented-here, but sometimes it is fun to play!  The philosophy of using Java so 
      that you have a cross platform solution is important.
